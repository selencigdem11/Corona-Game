The game is based on vital importance of keeping social distance with people 
when we are in crowded places. The cyclinder that enclosing the object 'Mathilda' 
represents the social distance measures. Mathilda should regard this cylinder
when she meets firends characters. If there exists a violation of social distance rule
Mathilda will lose her health. The game over situation occurs if she violate
social distance more than 3 times.  In this case, corona objects rain from above.
Mathilda wins the game if she succeds in keeping social distance with more
than 50 characters. We count those character numbers by pushing those characters into
array just before they are removed from scene thus, winning the game means that length of
removed object array exceed 20. In that case, baloons fly top from plane .

How you play this game?
With the direction keys on our keyboard, we will try to keep our distance with the Friends characters coming toward Mathilda.
